        <h2> Our story</h2>
        <p> Since becoming a chef I've worked towards making high end cuisine
            accessible. I believe that everyone has a right to be able to treat themselves to a 5 star michelin star
            meal from the comfort of their home. In this blog, I talk about how to repurpose some produce that have been
            sitting in your fridge by making them into delicious meals. </p>

        <h2> About Me</h2>
        <p > Cooking hasn't always been my career of choice. Befor that, I had hopes of becoming a
            dancer but chose to learn more about the art of high end cuisine. In this page, I bring to you my experience
            as a world renowned chef and the tips and tricks that have brought me where I am now. </p>
